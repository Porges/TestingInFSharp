module Summary
(*

    I like F# for testing
    - can test C# easily, integrate
      into existing codebases

    - makes for readable tests
      (and has libraries to help with that)

    - FsCheck makes testing easier
      can think about higher level properties
      rather than particular values

    - model-based testing takes this to a
      higher level so you think about invariants
      of a system rather than operations
